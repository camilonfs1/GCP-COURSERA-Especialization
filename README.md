# Learn about GCP on Coursera Specialization Program

This is an introduction and summary about the GCP specialization program offered on coursera, I would like the reader to have a tool and inspiration to learn about GCP and cloud services in general. I will try to update documentation and services as time progresses and google updates its catalog of services

## [Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure](https://github.com/camilonfs1/GCP-COURSERA-Especialization/tree/main/GCP%20Core%20Infraestructure)
"This course introduces you to important concepts and terminology for working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You learn about, and compare, many of the computing and storage services available in Google Cloud Platform, including Google App Engine, Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud SQL, and BigQuery. You learn about important resource and policy management tools, such as the Google Cloud Resource Manager hierarchy and Google Cloud Identity and Access Management. Hands-on labs give you foundational skills for working with GCP. Note: •Google services are currently unavailable in China" by [ Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org).

## [Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation](https://github.com/camilonfs1/GCP-COURSERA-Especialization/tree/main/GCP%20Fuoundation)

"This accelerated on-demand course introduces participants to the comprehensive and flexible infrastructure and platform services provided by Google Cloud with a focus on Compute Engine. Through a combination of video lectures, demos, and hands-on labs, participants explore and deploy solution elements, including infrastructure components such as networks, virtual machines and applications services. You will learn how to use the Google Cloud through the console and Cloud Shell. You'll also learn about the role of a cloud architect, approaches to infrastructure design, and virtual networking configuration with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Projects, Networks, Subnetworks, IP addresses, Routes, and Firewall rules. Prerequisites: To get the most out of this course, participants should have: • Completed Google Cloud Fundamentals: Core Infrastructure or have equivalent experience • Basic proficiency with command-line tools and Linux operating system environments • Systems Operations experience including deploying and managing applications, either on-premises or in a public cloud environment >>> By enrolling in this course you agree to the Qwiklabs Terms of Service as set out in the FAQ and located at: https://qwiklabs.com/terms_of_service <<<" by [ Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org).

"This accelerated on-demand course introduces participants to the comprehensive and flexible infrastructure and platform services provided by Google Cloud with a focus on Compute Engine. Through a combination of video lectures, demos, and hands-on labs, participants explore and deploy solution elements, including infrastructure components such as networks, systems and applications services. This course also covers deploying practical solutions including customer-supplied encryption keys, security and access management, quotas and billing, and resource monitoring" by [ Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org).


## [Elastic Google Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation](https://github.com/camilonfs1/GCP-COURSERA-Especialization/tree/main/Elastic%20GCP%20Scaling%20and%20Automation)

"This accelerated on-demand course introduces participants to the comprehensive and flexible infrastructure and platform services provided by Google Cloud. Through a combination of video lectures, demos, and hands-on labs, participants explore and deploy solution elements, including securely interconnecting networks, load balancing, autoscaling, infrastructure automation and managed services." by [ Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org).


## [Reliable Google Cloud Infrastructure: Design and Process](https://github.com/camilonfs1/GCP-COURSERA-Especialization/tree/main/Reliable%20GCP%20Design%20and%20Process)

"This course equips students to build highly reliable and efficient solutions on Google Cloud using proven design patterns. It is a continuation of the Architecting with Google Compute Engine or Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine courses and assumes hands-on experience with the technologies covered in either of those courses. Through a combination of presentations, design activities, and hands-on labs, participants learn to define and balance business and technical requirements to design Google Cloud deployments that are highly reliable, highly available, secure, and cost-effective." by [ Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org).
