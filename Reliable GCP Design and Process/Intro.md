# DESIGN AND PROCESS

"This course equips students to build highly reliable and efficient solutions on Google Cloud using proven design patterns. It is a continuation of the Architecting with Google Compute Engine or Architecting with Google Kubernetes Engine courses and assumes hands-on experience with the technologies covered in either of those courses. Through a combination of presentations, design activities, and hands-on labs, participants learn to define and balance business and technical requirements to design Google Cloud deployments that are highly reliable, highly available, secure, and cost-effective." by [ Coursera ](https://www.coursera.org).

## Introduction
Welcome to the Reliable Google Cloud Infrastructure: Design and Process course. Learn about the course structure and it's content.
## Defining Services
In this module, you will learn to describe users of a system in terms of the roles and personas they take. You will learn how to measure success using Key performance indicators (KPIs) and you will examine service level objectives (SLOs), service level indicators (SLIs), and service level agreements (SLAs).
## Microservice Design and Architecture
In this module, we introduce application architecture and microservice design.
## DevOps Automation
This module introduces DevOps automation, a key factor in achieving consistency, reliability, and speed of deployment.
## Choosing Storage Solutions
In this module, we discuss Google Cloud storage and data solutions and how to select the most suitable one to meet your business and technical requirements.
## Google Cloud and Hybrid Network Architecture
In this module, we discuss Google Cloud network architectures, including hybrid architectures
## Deploying Applications to Google Cloud
In this module, we discuss the different options of deploying applications to Google Cloud. Google Cloud offers many possible deployment platforms, and the choice is not always immediately obvious.
## Designing Reliable Systems
In this module, we talk about how to design reliable systems
## Security
In this module, we cover security. Google has been operating securely in the cloud for 20 years. There is a strong belief that security empowers innovation. The approach of the cloud architect should be that security should be put first; everything else will follow from this.
## Maintenance and Monitoring
In this final module of this course, we cover application maintenance and monitoring.
